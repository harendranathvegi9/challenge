# Challenge [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/michaelbazos/challenge.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/michaelbazos/challenge)

This is a sample application for an interview. The task is the following:

## Build and serve in production mode

The following command will build and serve the application in production mode
